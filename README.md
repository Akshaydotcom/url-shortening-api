### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size-> In Progress
- Shorten any valid URL-> In Progress
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser-> In Progress
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click-> In Progress

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Material UI](https://mui.com/) - For styles

### Why The Refresh

- Couple of Reasons, the main being I didn't like the layout of the previous attempt, and 2. The API used to shorten URLs has stopped working.
